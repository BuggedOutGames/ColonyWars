# Colony Wars

Colony Wars puts players in control of one of natures most fascinating creatures, Ants! Player's must collect resources to grow their ant population, build structures to access valuable locations, and clash with enemy ant factions in order for their colony to survive.

Featuring agent-based / emergent behavior, interactive environments, macro focused strategy, and massive scale (ironic?), there are plenty of stand out features to enjoy from Colony Wars.
